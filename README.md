# Kodi Netflix Launcher
Kodi addon script for launching the Windows app for Netflix and managing return to Kodi.



## Why?
For launching the Windows Netflix app while killing Kodi in the background, then restoring it on Netflix app quit.



## Usage:
Install the zip file from the release tab, or the repo via the Kodi addon installer.

You can right click the addon and change the Kodi install path in settings.



## Extension:
Feel free to edit the resources/main.py and add launch options for other operating systems.

My HTPC needs to be running Windows in my household so I haven't added os check and execute code for others.
